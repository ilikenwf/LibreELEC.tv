**Sx05RE**
An emulation (retro) fork for Sx05 devices, Most of the code is from [Kszaq's LE](https://github.com/kszaq/LibreELEC.tv) and [Lakka](https://github.com/libretro/Lakka-LibreELEC), I just combine them with some changes, add [Emulationstation](https://github.com/RetroPie/EmulationStation) and some standalone emulators ([Advancemame](https://github.com/amadvance/advancemame), [PPSSPP](https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp), Reicast and others). 

To build use:  

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade  
sudo apt install gcc make git gcc-multilib lib32stdc++6  
sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash (select no, to install bash as the default)  
git clone https://github.com/shantigilbert/LibreELEC.tv.git Sx05RE  
cd Sx05RE  
make image PROJECT=S905 ARCH=arm DISTRO=Sx05RE  

I use Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS

Please note, this is mostly a personal project made for my S905 Box (Mini M8S) I can't guarantee that it will work for your box as I don't own any other boxes, don't expect changes to fit your personal needs, but I do appreciate any PRs, help on testing other boxes and fixing issues.  

I have a very crappy laptop since my main one burned out, and I work on this project on my personal time, I don't make any money out of it, so it takes a while for me to properly test any changes, but I will do my best to help you fix issues you might have on other boxes limited to my time and experience. 

Happy retrogaming!
